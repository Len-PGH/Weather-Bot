# Weather-Bot
Signalwire Weather Bot



The JSON snippet you've provided appears to describe the configuration for an AI-driven system, likely a chatbot or an interactive voice response (IVR) system, with a focus on weather information retrieval and message handling. The JSON is structured to define various sections and functions that this system can perform. Let's break down the key components:

### Main Sections

1. **Answer Section (Empty)**:
   - This section is currently answers the call.

2. **Record Call**:
   - This part indicates that calls are recorded in WAV format and possibly in stereo (`"stereo": "true"`).

3. **AI Configuration**:
   - This is a complex section with various nested configurations, including parameters, prompts, language settings, and specific functions (SWAIG).

### Detailed AI Configuration

- **Params**:
  - Configures the AI with verbose logging (`"verbose_logs": "true"`).
  - Specifies a debug webhook URL.

- **Post Prompt Configuration**:
  - After the main interaction, it seems to follow up with a summary task (`"text": "Summarize the conversation"`).
  - The parameters `top_p` and `temperature` indicate how the AI generates responses, balancing creativity and relevance.

- **Pronounce Settings**:
  - This part suggests text replacement settings for speech synthesis, like replacing "mph" with "miles per hour".

- **Hints**:
  - These are likely keywords or topics to guide the AI, in this case, related to weather.

- **Languages**:
  - Specifies language settings for voice interactions, including voice names and filler phrases.

### SWAIG (Signalwire AI Gateway)

- **Defaults**:
  - Sets default values for webhook interactions, including authentication details.

- **Functions**: 
  - Various functions the AI can perform, each with a specific purpose, arguments, and data mapping.

   1. **Send Message Function**:
      - Sends text messages to a user with specified content.

   2. **Send MMS Function**:
      - Similar to the send message function but includes media content.

   3. **Get Latitude and Longitude Function**:
      - Retrieves geographical coordinates for a given city and state.

   4. **Get Weather Point Function**:
      - Fetches a detailed weather URL based on latitude and longitude.

   5. **Get Weather Detailed Forecast Function**:
      - Uses the URL from the weather point function to get a detailed forecast.

- **AI Prompt for Weather Expert**:
  - This prompt configures a sequence of steps for getting and delivering a weather forecast, suggesting the AI's role as a weather expert.


### Overall Structure

The JSON is well-structured, with clearly defined sections and nested objects, each serving a specific role in the system's configuration. The system appears to be quite versatile, handling various tasks from voice interactions and message sending to weather information retrieval.

This JSON configuration is likely part of a larger system, such as an automated customer service tool or an interactive assistant, capable of handling complex tasks and workflows. The detailed configuration allows for customization and fine-tuning of the AI's behavior and responses.
